NAME
    Tools::* - common utilities for common problems

DESCRIPTION
    The Tools::* modules are an attempt to abstract out common code for
    common problems. For example, it provides code to enable generic message
    logging and handling from programs, simple UI construction using
    Term::ReadLine, input parsing/validating, loading of files and so on.

    See below for a more elaborate package description.

MODULES
    Tools::Load
        Allows for generic loading of modules and files. Simply give it the
        name of a module or file and it will Do What You Mean (tm).

    Tools::Check
        Allows for generic input checking and validating using a powerfull
        templating system

    Tools::Cmd
        Allows for the searching and execution of any binary on your system.
        It adheres to verbosity settings and is able to run intereactive. It
        also has an option to capture output/error buffers.

    Tools::Term
        Provides methods to ask both elaborate questions as well as simple
        yes/no questions via a Term::ReadLine interface using a template. It
        can also parse options per unix style.

    Tools::Module
        Allows you to query the state of modules on your system. It can tell
        you if you have certain modules installed without attempting to
        "use" them and can do smart loading of modules. Also it can tell you
        what *other* modules a certain module requires.

    Tools::SQL
        Allows for simple execution of SQL statements, eliminating the
        overhead of preparing and executing the queries. Simply provide the
        statement and the value(s) that need to be inserted and Tools::SQL
        will Do What You Mean (tm).

    Tools::Log
        This module enables you to do generic message logging throughout
        programs and projects. Every message will be logged with
        stacktraces, timestamps and so on. You can use built-in handlers
        immediately, or after the fact when you inspect the error stack. It
        is highly configurable and let's you even provide your own handlers
        for dealing with messages.
